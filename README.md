## Class and Object Creation

> **Check out :** [ObjectCreation.py](https://github.com/somrajchowdhury/PythonCodes/blob/master/ObjectCreation.py)

Not surprisingly, all of us know how important role the classes and objects play in the programming language sphere.

## Function Overloading

> **Check out :** [FunctionOverloading.py](https://github.com/somrajchowdhury/PythonCodes/blob/master/FunctionOverloading.py)

Some of my friends and books said function overloading isn't that popular in python, well this program might just serve the purpose.

## Menu Driven Calculator

> **Check out :** [SimpleMenuDrivenCalculator.py](https://github.com/somrajchowdhury/PythonCodes/blob/master/SimpleMenuDrivenCalculator.py)

This calculator will not stop taking inputs even if you are tired. But you can comment the `while(True)` statement and give the calculator some rest.

## Stack Operations

> **Check out :** [StackOperations.py](https://github.com/somrajchowdhury/PythonCodes/blob/master/StackOperations.py)

If you are new to the family of Data Structures, then firstly you should introduce yourself to Mr. Stack. He is simple and easy.

## Swap Two Numbers Without a Third Variable

> **Check out :** [SwappingTwoNumbers.py](https://github.com/somrajchowdhury/PythonCodes/blob/master/SwappingTwoNumbers.py)

Well, swapping of two numbers can't get anymore easier with the Simultaneous assignments in Python 3.

## Look out for a Leap Year

> **Check out :** [LeapYear.py](https://github.com/somrajchowdhury/PythonCodes/blob/master/LeapYear.py)

Still have a confusion on how many days a Leap Year has? Well, i won't say it, run the code and get all the answers you need about leap year and a normal year.

## BuiltIn Methods of List Data Structure

> **Check out :** [ListMethods.py](https://github.com/somrajchowdhury/PythonCodes/blob/master/ListMethods.py)

This PythonCode is the one stop shop for all the beginners and intermediates who would like to brush-up the List methods in Python 3. **NOTE : Comments are not to be ignored in this code.**

## Second Largest Number in a List

> **Check out :** [SecondLargestNumber.py](https://github.com/somrajchowdhury/PythonCodes/blob/master/SecondLargestNumber.py)

For years, the Most Wanted number was the Largest number, this time the Second Largest number is the Criminal. Let us find and print him out.

## Largest Even and Largest Odd Number in a List

> **Check out :** [LargestEven&OddNumber.py](https://github.com/somrajchowdhury/PythonCodes/blob/master/LargestEven&OddNumber.py)

As per news reports from pythoNEWSTv, the Most Wanted number was the Largest number again. Reports clearly mention their names as Mr.Largest ODD and Mr.Largest EVEN. Let us get our hands dirty.
