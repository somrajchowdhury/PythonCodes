> This repository contains some basic python programs.

## Program to :

- [Create a Class and Objects](#class-and-object-creation)
- [Overload a Function](#function-overloading)
- [Implement a Menu Driven Calculator](#menu-driven-calculator)
- [Perform Simple Stack Operations](#stack-operations)
- [Swap Two Numbers without a Third Variable](#swap-two-numbers-without-a-third-variable)
- [Check if a Year is a Leap Year](#look-out-for-a-leap-year)

## Class and Object Creation

> **Check out :** [ObjectCreation.py](https://github.com/somrajchowdhury/PythonCodes/blob/master/ObjectCreation.py)

Not surprisingly, all of us know how important role the classes and objects play in the programming language sphere. 

## Function Overloading

> **Check out :** [FunctionOverloading.py](https://github.com/somrajchowdhury/PythonCodes/blob/master/FunctionOverloading.py)

Some of my friends and books said function overloading isn't that popular in python, well this program might just serve the purpose.

## Menu Driven Calculator

> **Check out :** [SimpleMenuDrivenCalculator.py](https://github.com/somrajchowdhury/PythonCodes/blob/master/SimpleMenuDrivenCalculator.py)

This calculator will not stop taking inputs even if you are tired. But you can comment the `while(True)` statement and give the calculator some rest.

## Stack Operations

> **Check out :** [StackOperations.py](https://github.com/somrajchowdhury/PythonCodes/blob/master/StackOperations.py)

If you are new to the family of Data Structures, then firstly you should introduce yourself to Mr. Stack. He is simple and easy.

## Swap Two Numbers Without a Third Variable

> **Check out :** [SwappingTwoNumbers.py](https://github.com/somrajchowdhury/PythonCodes/blob/master/SwappingTwoNumbers.py)

Well, swapping of two numbers can't get anymore easier with the Simultaneous assignments in Python 3.

## Look out for a Leap Year

> **Check out :** [LeapYear.py](https://github.com/somrajchowdhury/PythonCodes/blob/master/LeapYear.py)

Still have a confusion on how many days a Leap Year has? Well, i won't say it, run the code and get all the answers you need about leap year and a normal year.
