## Class and Object Creation

> **Check out :** [ObjectCreation.py](https://github.com/somrajchowdhury/PythonCodes/blob/master/ObjectCreation.py)

Not surprisingly, all of us know how important role the classes and objects play in the programming language sphere.

## Function Overloading

> **Check out :** [FunctionOverloading.py](https://github.com/somrajchowdhury/PythonCodes/blob/master/FunctionOverloading.py)

Some of my friends and books said function overloading isn't that popular in python, well this program might just serve the purpose.

## Menu Driven Calculator

> **Check out :** [SimpleMenuDrivenCalculator.py](https://github.com/somrajchowdhury/PythonCodes/blob/master/SimpleMenuDrivenCalculator.py)

This calculator will not stop taking inputs even if you are tired. But you can comment the `while(True)` statement and give the calculator some rest.

## Stack Operations

> **Check out :** [StackOperations.py](https://github.com/somrajchowdhury/PythonCodes/blob/master/StackOperations.py)

If you are new to the family of Data Structures, then firstly you should introduce yourself to Mr. Stack. He is simple and easy.

## Swap Two Numbers Without a Third Variable

> **Check out :** [SwappingTwoNumbers.py](https://github.com/somrajchowdhury/PythonCodes/blob/master/SwappingTwoNumbers.py)

Well, swapping of two numbers can't get anymore easier with the Simultaneous assignments in Python 3.

> ![Swaping Two Numbers](https://github.com/somrajchowdhury/PythonCodes/blob/master/Outputs/SwappingTwoNumbers.png "Swap Two Numbers Without a Third Variable")

## Look out for a Leap Year

> **Check out :** [LeapYear.py](https://github.com/somrajchowdhury/PythonCodes/blob/master/LeapYear.py)

Still have a confusion on how many days a Leap Year has? Well, i won't say it, run the code and get all the answers you need about leap year and a normal year.

## BuiltIn Methods of List Data Structure

> **Check out :** [ListMethods.py](https://github.com/somrajchowdhury/PythonCodes/blob/master/ListMethods.py)

This PythonCode is the one stop shop for all the beginners and intermediates who would like to brush-up the List methods in Python 3. **NOTE : Comments are not to be ignored in this code.**

## Second Largest Number in a List

> **Check out :** [SecondLargestNumber.py](https://github.com/somrajchowdhury/PythonCodes/blob/master/SecondLargestNumber.py)

For years, the Most Wanted number was the Largest number, this time the Second Largest number is the Criminal. Let us find and print him out.
