# PythonCodes

> This repository contains some basic python programs.

## Program to :

- [Create a Class and Objects](#Class-and-Object-Creation)
- [Overload a function](#Function-Overloading)

## Class and Object Creation

**Check out :** `ObjectCreation.py`

Not surprisingly, all of us know how important role the classes and objects play in the programming language sphere. 

## Function Overloading

**Check out :** `FunctionOverloading.py'

Some of my friends and books said funtion overloading isn't that popular in python, well this program might just serve the purpose.
