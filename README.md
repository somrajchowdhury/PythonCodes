## Program to :

- [Overload a function](#Function-Overloading)
- [Implement a Menu Driven Calculator](#Menu-Driven-Calculator)

## Class and Object Creation

**Check out :** `ObjectCreation.py`

Not surprisingly, all of us know how important role the classes and objects play in the programming language sphere. 

## Function Overloading

**Check out :** `FunctionOverloading.py`

Some of my friends and books said funtion overloading isn't that popular in python, well this program might just serve the purpose.

## Menu Driven Calculator

**Check out :** `SimpleMenuDrivenCalculator.py`

This calculator will not stop taking inputs even if you are tired. But you can comment the `while(True)` statement and give the calculator some rest.
