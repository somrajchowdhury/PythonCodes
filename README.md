- [Create a Class and Objects](#Class-and-Object-Creation)
- [Overload a Function](#Function-Overloading)
- [Implement a Menu Driven Calculator](#Menu-Driven-Calculator)
- [Perform Simple Stack Operations](#Stack-Operations)

## Class and Object Creation

**Check out :** `ObjectCreation.py`

Not surprisingly, all of us know how important role the classes and objects play in the programming language sphere. 

## Function Overloading

**Check out :** `FunctionOverloading.py`

Some of my friends and books said function overloading isn't that popular in python, well this program might just serve the purpose.

## Menu Driven Calculator

**Check out :** `SimpleMenuDrivenCalculator.py`

This calculator will not stop taking inputs even if you are tired. But you can comment the `while(True)` statement and give the calculator some rest.

## Stack Operations

**Check out :** [StackOperations.py](https://github.com/somrajchowdhury/PythonCodes/blob/master/StackOperations.py)

If you are new to the family of Data Structures, then firstly you should introduce yourself to Mr. Stack. He is simple and easy.
